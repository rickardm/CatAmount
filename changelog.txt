--------------------------------------
* Remove all hyphens from formulated file names, because ArcGIS
  doesn't allow them.
* Change all CSV output to be separated by commas rather than tabs.
* Improve the way CSV and descriptive output is formulated.
* Change home/away to be an attribute of a Fix, rather than a cluster
  keeping a list of home and away points.
* Add sun_metrics module, which gives the ability to differentiate
  between night and day for any given date and location.
* Add output format "csv-all" to Find Clusters and Find Crossings.
  These provide csv output of every point in a cluster or crossing.
* For Find Clusters and Find Crossings, have each Fix determine if it
  is a day or night datum.
* Change the CSV and descriptive output of a Fix to include day/night
  determinations.

--------------------------------------
* Change the main data file format from tab-separated to comma-separated
  for office compatibility reasons.
* Add major function match_field_sites_to_clusters, for finding clusters
  that match a field verified site.
* Organize code to use a "project" of related modules, to make the
  code more modular, and for the more immediate need of reusing the
  clustering from find_clusters.
* Revise the User Guide to reflect the recent changes.

2012-05-11 21:42 utc - MRR - 13417.629
--------------------------------------
* Change time measurements from days to hours to provide the precision
  needed by researchers.
* In the GUI, provide "major" and "minor" incrementing buttons, to
  make incrementing the settings both fast and accurate.
* Change the default text format from "descriptive" to "csv".
* Make the text window wider to break fewer lines when using CSV
  output.
* Add new major function, find_whodunit, for finding the cat when you
  know the location and time.
* Add GUI elements necessary to use find_whodunit feature
* Various efficiencies to the code.
* Refactoring the code for style issues.
* Revise the User Guide to reflect the changes mentioned
  (find_whodunit, days->hours, descriptive->csv).

--------------------------------------
* Fix bug in Find Clusters where when csv output is selected, save as
  file name should end with ".csv".
* Adjust csv headers for integration with Arcmap: 10 characters max,
  no spaces, no symbols, can't start with numeral.
